<strong>1. <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=211">Ivy Lace Tablecloth, Saffron Marigold:</a> </strong> Everyone has a white tablecloth, but why use something that is just a necessary evil when you could  enhance and highlight everything in the room?  All Saffron Marigold tablecloths are 100% cotton (no polyester here!), and made with the highest quality materials and practices.  This kind of quality underscores your whole design, without calling undue attention to itself.

<strong>2. <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=661">Vanilla Glacé dinner napkins, Saffron Marigold</a>: </strong>Dreamy and decadent, these napkins will add just the right amount of gilded glamour to your table and will beg to be touched. Napkin rings in bronze or with a gilt finish will really set them off.

<strong>3. <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=273">Paisley au Lait dinner napkins, Saffron Marigold</a>: </strong>Black and white, a classic combination the never fails. Steel grey paisley motifs on white make these superior grade cotton napkins an absolute must. Grey is a popular neutral and these napkins make an elegant table setting.

<strong>4. <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=796">Filigree dinner napkins, Saffron Marigold</a></strong>: For sheer Hollywood glamour, nothing beats Filigree napkins. Channel a bit of 40's romance, turn on some Sinatra and you have the makings of a lovely Thanksgiving.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>
Decorating entirely in neutral colors can create a space that is soothing, sophisticated and warm if it is done well. The trick is to mix varying shades of white like taupe, cream and grey. Keep <strong>accessories</strong> warm and introduce textures like wood, slate and stone for a nature inspired palette.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>
Sometimes the addition of a single handmade object can change the entire feel of a room. Handmade accessories are imprinted with the stories of the people who make them, and add whimsy and a ton of character to a room. Look for <strong>accessories</strong> that have interesting shapes, like pottery and vases, that are to scale with the rest of the display.

<h3>Table Linens</h3>
<strong>Global</strong> decor blends a mix of international cultures into one cohesive, eclectic home. Allow countries' treasures to mingle.
